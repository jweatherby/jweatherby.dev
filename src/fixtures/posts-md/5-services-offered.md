## Software Excellence

As Software Director of a diverse group of teams overseeing products valued in the hundreds of millions, I have an excellent track record of building high performing teams in a psychologically safe environment, for remote and hybrid work places. I also specialize in accelerating product-development processes using industry best practices and standards.

## Notion Workspace Consultation
