# REF: Roles & Expectations Framework

In my experience as a Leader in Software, I’ve always had a Venn diagram in my head of what I expect from the individuals on my teams. As it turns out, that Venn diagram gets very messy, very fast. Luckily, I have a penchant for Notion and it has the tools to illustrate exactly how I’d like this content conveyed. This is a rundown of the framework and the finer points and caveats when using it.

## The Framework

The framework I put together has 2 major sections: definitions and role mapping. 

Definitions encompasses the outlined expectations and signals to look out for providing demonstrable evidence that an expectation is being met. Opening the entry, because notion loves its icebergs of content, you can find different aspects that make up that expectation. From those examples an informed assessment can be made and individuals can see what's required to progress to the next level.

Role mapping includes the degree of proficiency an individual is expected to achieve. If an expectation is not listed, it's not worth evaluating on. Different roles will have different priorities, which I've attempted to map out here. These are guidelines and will likely need to be adjusted in some circumstances. 

### Expectations

Below is a list of expectations I have from my teams along with definitions, signals and core expectations. The expectations are high level components of what I’d expect to see.

[![Expectation definitions](/images/post-images/8-expectation-definitions.png)](https://www.notion.so/jweatherby/16f3b75bf3f880a4a4b7c8402743317c?v=16f3b75bf3f88001af33000cd014b3fd&pvs=4)

They boil down to these 5: 

- **Execution** - The ability to *get it done*. This should always be the highest priority, because when all is said and done, if you don’t deliver impactful results, the rest doesn’t really matter. The definition encompasses individual impact and includes components like communication, project management, initiative, etc.
- **Craft** - In software, these are the day-to-day fundamentals to building software. Where Execution is an emphasis on “How it’s done”, Craft would be “What is done”. Craft highlights the hard skills related to the impact of technical contributions.
- **Design** - Complementary to Craft, this is the macro component - establishing technical strategy and vision, designing solutions using that direction, and deftly guiding the solutions in that direction. It is synonymous with Technical Leadership, but is not exclusive to leadership and should have contributions and ownership from varying levels.
- **Enablement** - This is the impact you have on the team and project. It’s about contributing to a group’s wellbeing, culture and emotional health. There are some components that are inherent in day-to-day operations, and some that require proactive actions, like mentoring and coaching.
- **Management** - For lack of a better word, these are responsibilities that are typically owned by people leaders involved in building and optimizing high performing teams. They’re traditionally owned by people leaders, but others can, and should, contribute to a selection of these activities to some degree.

As a leader in software, these are the main things I look for when asked by a report, “How am I doing?” Within each of the entries, you can open it to find a list of additional examples detailing what would be expected at the different levels from **Contributes → Mastery**. However, depending on the role and level, different expectations will have different emphasis. That’s where the second table comes in: it references a selection of the defined expectations, but will clearly state what should be prioritized and expected proficiency. These are guidelines, and as with anything, some individuals will prove to be exceptions to the rule. 

### Priorities

[![Dev priority and proficiency expectations](/images/post-images/8-dev-expectations.png)](https://www.notion.so/jweatherby/16f3b75bf3f880f8a5d4f38983ea40f6?v=1723b75bf3f88030a757000c7e397ea9&pvs=4)


The priorities are as follows: 

- **1..n** - if there’s ever a question of what should be prioritized, the lower value should come first. For example, with newly minted devs, I would expect Craft to be prioritized over Design. We want to make sure you have all the fundamentals down before going into larger design considerations.
- **“+”** - this is a constant expectation. It’s not prioritized because it’s just something that simply must be done and continually considered. It typically encompasses Execution, and often Enablement. Execution is constant because if you don’t deliver, what did you actually accomplish? And Enablement because we’re all part of the bigger picture and need to consider our impact on the groups and communities we’re part of.

### Proficiencies

[![Team Lead priority and proficiency expectations](/images/post-images/8-team-lead-expectations.png)](https://www.notion.so/jweatherby/16f3b75bf3f880f8a5d4f38983ea40f6?v=1723b75bf3f88046b2be000ca8f9dcce&pvs=4)

The different proficiencies outlined include: 

- **Contributes** - Provides to the activities and expectations listed to varying degrees. This can include performing the activities, contributing feedback and adhering to outlined processes
- **Proficient** - An advanced level of contributions and more understanding of the nuances involved in activities performed.
- **Mastery** - Complete knowledge of a domain, with a full understanding of the landscape and compromises that come with different approaches. Plans, acts and communicates as an authority on subject matter.
- **Ownership** - Demonstrates mastery, and indicates responsibility for the applicable domain, whether project or team level. Has the final say on matters, and is ultimately responsible for any outcome
- **Oversight** - Holds the individuals with ownership accountable and provides support, guidance and direction as needed. Should also demonstrate mastery over a given domain or area of responsibility.

### Scope

The one other area to draw attention to is the type of proficiency: **In-Team** and **Cross-Team** (**X-Team**). Different roles will have different scopes of responsibility and levels of ownership. In-team has proven to be pretty straightforward, but cross-team and org level opens a can of worms. Mileage may vary according to the organizational setup. But, because of the framework's flexibility, it's easy to create a pseudo-RACI and layout the expectations across the different software levels, even all the way up to departmental or organizational layers.

## Beyond the framework

At the moment, this framework only encompasses activities, processes and outcomes at a single team and multiple team level (eng manager+). It does not account for project related expectations because those are related to business outcomes and are a whole different topic in itself. Within the business strategy and decided projects, each team must perform and that's where this framework applies. Rely on your friendly neighbourhood product team for those objectives and outcomes.

## Applying the framework

*If you're a Notion enthusiast, this section is for you. If not, simply use the framework as reference material and apply however you like.*

You can use the [Notion template provided here](https://www.notion.so/jweatherby/Applying-Roles-Expectations-1873b75bf3f880c1b9d7fbaccc42eaaa?pvs=4) to provide individual assessments. It is broken down into 2 sections: Assessments and Assessment Outcomes. Assessments is a way to group and summarize the information, and Assessment Outcomes provide a place to finalize the assessment with notes, feedback, and action items.
