When it comes to Software Engineering, it's hard to get started. You study it in school. You practice it at home. When you find that first job, there's so much more to learn. There are decades of information to catch up on. In the scramble to make your code behave, make it efficient, and make that deadline, sometimes fundamentals and principles are forgotten.

This series will be a reflection of the principles and best practices I've learned throughout my 10+ years as a Full Stack Web Developer. I will showcase design patterns, snippets of code, and the critical decisions I've made to build and maintain robust codebases throughout my career.

I'm going to show you how to connect the frontend and backend in a reasonable way; how to properly structure your code; snippets that will keep your code simple and elegant; approaches for test strategy; and best practices to keep future you, happy.

*The languages I use in my day to day are Python and JavaScript, so my code examples will be primarily in those languages.*
